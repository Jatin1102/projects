                        <p>Nobel prize winner Douglass North (1991) defines institutions as ‘humanely devised
                            constraints that structure political,
                            economic and social interaction.’ Institutions provide societies and individuals with a
                            level of organization and
                            security that is welfare enhancing both in good times and, perhaps especially, during
                            times of uncertainty and crisis.
                            Douglass North observes: ‘Throughout history, institutions have been devised by human
                            beings to create order and reduce
                            uncertainty in exchange.’ North assigns institutions a crucial role in the economy:
                            ‘Institutions provide the incentive
                            structure of an economy; as that structure evolves, it shapes the direction of economic
                            change towards growth,
                            stagnation, or decline.’
                            <br><br>
                            Institutions play a major role in our economy. Learning how the economy works and how it
                            can be governed requires an
                            understanding of economic institutions. Completion of the programme will prepare you for
                            a career as a professional
                            economist in government or business or provide you with a solid basis for an academic

                        <p>Nobel prize winner Douglass North (1991) defines institutions as ‘humanely devised
                            constraints that structure political,
                            economic and social interaction.’ Institutions provide societies and individuals with a
                            level of organization and
                            security that is welfare enhancing both in good times and, perhaps especially, during
                            times of uncertainty and crisis.
                            Douglass North observes: ‘Throughout history, institutions have been devised by human
                            beings to create order and reduce
                            uncertainty in exchange.’ North assigns institutions a crucial role in the economy:
                            ‘Institutions provide the incentive
                            structure of an economy; as that structure evolves, it shapes the direction of economic
                            change towards growth,
                            stagnation, or decline.’

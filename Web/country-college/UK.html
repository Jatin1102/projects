                    <h3>Cost of Study</h3>
                    <p>The island country Australia is attracting more and more international students from all around
                        the globe. Some of the
                        top universities and colleges in the world are located in Australia and thus, Australia is
                        becoming the new favourite
                        among students. The Australian education system is another factor that adds to its
                        attractability. Owing to its
                        proximity to the Indian sub-continent, Indians student prefer to study in Australia rather than
                        the western countries.
                        But how much does education in Australia costs? Read Cost of Studying in Australia to know more.
                        The tuition fee differs
                        from university to university as well as the type of programme and course you opt for.</p>
                    <h3>Cost of Living</h3>
                    <p>Australia ranks amongst the top 10 in the Human Development Index as well as the Quality of Life
                        Index. In simple words,
                        a developed nation, Australia is amongst the top countries of the world in terms of its
                        education system, the GDP and
                        purchasing power parity indexes. With a high level of incomes, it also enjoys a high level of
                        health awareness, an
                        excellent medical system as well as a politically stable economy.</p>

                    <h3>Working while studying</h3>
                    <p>Australian Immigration Laws are comparatively easy when it comes to working while studying. A
                        slight request would often
                        make you eligible to work in Australia as an international student. Though the rules might vary,
                        generally students are
                        allowed to work for up to 40 weeks in a year.</p>

                        <p>Australia is the largest country, geographically, and is a continent in itself. It lies in
                            the southern hemisphere so
                            the weather changes are opposite than those of India. Australia has five of the 30 best
                            cities in the world for students
                            to live in based on student mix, affordability, quality of life, and employment
                            opportunities. The capital of Australia
                            is Canberra.</p>

                        <p><strong>Education system:</strong>Australia has the third-highest number of international
                            students in the world after the United Kingdom and the United
                            States. It also has seven of the top 100 universities in the world. Australia's national
                            quality assurance system is
                            unique in its structure and rigor. The Australian Quality Training Framework has been set up
                            by the government to
                            strengthen the quality assurance processes in education.</p>

                        <p> <strong>Safety in Australia:</strong> Australia is a multicultural society that welcomes
                            people from other cultures, countries, and
                            backgrounds. While the majority of Indian students studying in Australia have a positive
                            experience of living and
                            studying in Australia, there were a number of incidents of assault as well as of robbery
                            during 2009 and 2010, which
                            affected not only Indian students but also members of the larger Indian community in
                            Australia. Presently, no such
                            incidents have been reported and active efforts have been made by the Australian government
                            to prevent such untoward
                            incidents from happening in future.</p>

                            Australia is diverse in its geography and climate. The country is located in the southern
                            hemisphere. This means
                            Australia's summer starts in December and winter begins in June. Nearly a third of Australia
                            is in the tropics where the
                            average temperatures are in the mid 20 degrees Celsius. The southern areas are in a
                            temperate zone.
